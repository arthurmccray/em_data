"""
Finding a Dataset
=================

``em_database`` ships an index of every dataset it knows about, and three
functions for querying it: :func:`~em_database.datasets`,
:func:`~em_database.search` and :func:`~em_database.filter`. All three return
dataset objects, so anything they hand back can be downloaded directly.

Nothing here touches the network - the index is metadata that ships with the
package, and querying it never opens a file.

# Every dataset in the index.
print(len(em_database.datasets()), "datasets")

# %%
# ``search`` is the browser widget's search box, callable. It matches a
# lowercased blob of every field - name, description, technique, detector,
# microscope, tags, authors and their affiliations - and every whitespace
# separated term has to appear somewhere, though not in the same field.
for ds in em_database.search("amorphous"):

# Because terms may land in different fields, a query can combine what an
# instrument is with what the technique was.
for ds in em_database.search("jeol eels"):

# %%
# ``filter`` matches named fields instead. Strings compare exactly but
# case-insensitively, ``tags`` and ``authors`` test membership, and a list
# means any of its values.

# returned the whole index would be worse than an error.
